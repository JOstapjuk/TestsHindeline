## 🔧 What You Need to Get Started

### Required Software (Don't worry - these are free!)

#### 1. **Python** (Version 3.8 or newer)
- **What it is**: A programming language we'll use for testing
- **How to check if you have it**: Open a terminal/command prompt and type `python --version`
- **If you don't have it**: Download from https://python.org (choose the latest version)

#### 2. **Node.js** (Version 18 or newer)
- **What it is**: A tool that lets you run JavaScript outside of web browsers
- **How to check if you have it**: Open a terminal and type `node --version`
- **If you don't have it**: Download from https://nodejs.org

#### 3. **Git** (Optional but helpful)
- **What it is**: A tool for tracking changes in your code
- **How to check if you have it**: Type `git --version` in terminal
- **If you don't have it**: Download from https://git-scm.com

#### 4. **Chrome Browser**
- **What it is**: A web browser (you probably already have this!)
- **Why we need it**: Selenium uses it to test websites

### System Requirements
- **Computer**: Any modern computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- **Memory**: At least 4GB RAM (8GB is better)
- **Storage**: 2GB free space
- **Internet**: For downloading tools and running some tests

## 🚀 Setting Up Your Testing Environment

### Step 1: Download the Project

**Option A: If you have Git installed**
```bash
# Copy this command into your terminal
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd testing_v2
```

**Option B: If you don't have Git**
1. Download the project as a ZIP file
2. Extract it to a folder on your computer
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder

### Step 2: Set Up Python (This is like preparing your Python workspace)

**What we're doing**: Creating a separate environment for Python so our testing tools don't interfere with other Python projects.

```bash
# Step 2a: Create a virtual environment (think of it as a separate workspace)
python -m venv venv

# Step 2b: Activate the virtual environment (enter the workspace)
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 2c: Install the testing tools we need
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What each command does**:
- `python -m venv venv`: Creates a new folder called "venv" with a clean Python environment
- `activate`: Tells your computer to use this specific Python environment
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`: Downloads and installs all the testing tools we need

### Step 3: Set Up JavaScript Testing

```bash
# Step 3a: Install JavaScript testing tools
npm install

# Step 3b: Install browsers for testing
npx playwright install
```

**What each command does**:
- `npm install`: Downloads JavaScript testing tools
- `npx playwright install`: Downloads browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) for testing

### Step 4: Check That Everything Works

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# Check Node.js version  
node --version

# Check if pytest is installed
pytest --version

# Check if Playwright is installed
npx playwright --version
```

**If you see version numbers**: Great! You're ready to start.
**If you see errors**: Don't worry! Check the troubleshooting section at the end.

## 🐍 Learning Python Testing with Pytest

### What is Pytest?

**Pytest** is a tool that helps you test Python code. Think of it like having a robot that:
1. Runs your code with different inputs
2. Checks if the results are what you expected
3. Tells you if something went wrong

### Let's Look at Your First Test

Open `python_tests/test_basic.py` in a text editor. Here's what you'll see:

```python
import pytest

class TestBasicMath:
    """Basic math operations tests"""
    
    def test_addition(self):
        """Test basic addition"""
        assert 2 + 2 == 4
        assert 10 + 5 == 15
    
    def test_multiplication(self):
        """Test basic multiplication"""
        assert 3 * 4 == 12
        assert 2 * 0 == 0
```

**Let's break this down**:
- `import pytest`: Brings in the testing tools
- `class TestBasicMath`: Groups related tests together
- `def test_addition(self):`: This is one test function
- `assert 2 + 2 == 4`: This checks if 2 + 2 equals 4. If it does, the test passes!

### Understanding Test Structure

Every test has three parts:
1. **Arrange**: Set up what you need for the test
2. **Act**: Do the thing you want to test
3. **Assert**: Check if the result is what you expected

**Example**:
```python
def test_adding_numbers():
    # Arrange: Set up the numbers
    num1 = 5
    num2 = 3
    
    # Act: Add them together
    result = num1 + num2
    
    # Assert: Check if the result is correct
    assert result == 8
```

### Running Your First Python Test

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project folder and virtual environment is activated
cd testing_v2
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Run all Python tests
pytest python_tests/ -v

# Run just the basic tests
pytest python_tests/test_basic.py -v

# Run a specific test
pytest python_tests/test_basic.py::TestBasicMath::test_addition -v
```

**Understanding the output**:
- `PASSED`: Your test worked correctly! 🎉
- `FAILED`: Something went wrong. Check the error message.
- `v`: Shows detailed information about what's happening

### Understanding Fixtures

**What is a fixture?** A fixture is like a helper that prepares data for your tests.

Look at this example from `test_basic.py`:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def sample_list():
    """Fixture providing a sample list"""
    return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def test_list_operations(sample_list):
    """Test list operations using fixture"""
    assert len(sample_list) == 5
    sample_list.append(6)
    assert len(sample_list) == 6
    assert sample_list[-1] == 6
```

**What's happening**:
- `@pytest.fixture`: Tells pytest this is a helper function
- `def sample_list():`: Creates a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- `def test_list_operations(sample_list):`: The test uses the list from the fixture

## 🌐 Learning Web Testing with Selenium

### What is Selenium?

**Selenium** is a tool that controls web browsers automatically. It's like having a robot that:
1. Opens Chrome or Firefox
2. Goes to websites
3. Clicks buttons and fills out forms
4. Checks if the website works correctly

### Let's Look at Your First Selenium Test

Open `selenium_tests/test_selenium_basic.py`. Here's what you'll see:

```python
def test_google_search(driver):
    """Test basic Google search functionality"""
    driver.get("https://www.google.com")
    
    # Find search box and perform search
    search_box = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.NAME, "q"))
    )
    search_box.send_keys("pytest selenium testing")
    search_box.send_keys("\n")
    
    # Wait for results and verify
    WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "search"))
    )
    
    # Verify search results contain expected text
    results = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "h3")
    assert len(results) > 0, "No search results found"
```

**Let's break this down**:
- `driver.get("https://www.google.com")`: Opens Google in the browser
- `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(...)`: Waits up to 10 seconds for something to appear
- `By.NAME, "q"`: Finds the search box (Google's search box has name="q")
- `search_box.send_keys("pytest selenium testing")`: Types text into the search box
- `assert len(results) > 0`: Checks that we got search results

### Understanding Web Elements

Websites are made up of **elements**:
- **Buttons**: Things you can click
- **Input fields**: Boxes where you type text
- **Links**: Text or images you can click to go to other pages
- **Images**: Pictures on the page

**How Selenium finds elements**:
- `By.NAME`: Find by the "name" attribute
- `By.ID`: Find by the "id" attribute  
- `By.CLASS_NAME`: Find by the "class" attribute
- `By.CSS_SELECTOR`: Find using CSS selectors (more advanced)

### Running Your First Selenium Test

```bash
# Run all Selenium tests
pytest selenium_tests/ -v

# Run just one test
pytest selenium_tests/test_selenium_basic.py::test_google_search -v
```

**What happens when you run the test**:
1. Chrome browser opens (you might see it flash by)
2. Goes to Google
3. Types in the search box
4. Waits for results
5. Checks that results appeared
6. Closes the browser

## 🟨 Learning JavaScript Testing

### What is JavaScript Testing?

**JavaScript testing** checks if your web page's interactive features work correctly. This includes:
- Buttons that change when clicked
- Forms that submit data
- Animations and visual effects
- User interactions

### Interactive Testing Playground

**Step 1**: Open the interactive testing page
```bash
# Open this file in your web browser
open javascript_tests/index.html  # Mac
start javascript_tests/index.html  # Windows
```

**What you'll see**: A webpage with lots of buttons and test sections. This is your testing playground!

### Understanding the JavaScript Test Framework

Open `javascript_tests/test-framework.js` to see how our custom testing tool works:

```javascript
class TestFramework {
    test(name, testFunction) {
        this.tests.push({ name, testFunction });
    }

    assertEqual(actual, expected, message = 'Values are not equal') {
        if (actual !== expected) {
            throw new Error(`${message}. Expected: ${expected}, Actual: ${actual}`);
        }
    }
}
```

**What this does**:
- `test(name, testFunction)`: Adds a new test to our test suite
- `assertEqual(actual, expected)`: Checks if two values are the same

### Looking at JavaScript Tests

Open `javascript_tests/tests.js`:

```javascript
test('Addition should work correctly', () => {
    assertEqual(2 + 2, 4);
    assertEqual(10 + 5, 15);
});

test('String operations should work', () => {
    const str = "Hello World";
    assertEqual(str.length, 11);
    assertEqual(str.toUpperCase(), "HELLO WORLD");
});
```

**How to run these tests**:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click "Run All Tests" button
3. Watch the results appear!

### Understanding DOM Testing

**DOM** stands for "Document Object Model" - it's how JavaScript interacts with web pages.

```javascript
test('Element selection should work', () => {
    const element = document.getElementById('test-paragraph');
    assertNotNull(element);
    assertEqual(element.tagName, 'P');
});
```

**What this does**:
- `document.getElementById('test-paragraph')`: Finds an element with id="test-paragraph"
- `assertNotNull(element)`: Checks that the element was found
- `element.tagName`: Gets the type of element (P = paragraph)

### Running JavaScript Tests with Playwright

Playwright is a more advanced tool for testing JavaScript in browsers:

```bash
# Run Playwright tests
npx playwright test

# Run with browser visible
npx playwright test --headed

# Run with interactive UI
npx playwright test --ui
```

## 🔄 Understanding GitHub Actions

### What is GitHub Actions?

**GitHub Actions** is like having a robot assistant that:
1. Watches your code for changes
2. Automatically runs all your tests
3. Tells you if anything broke
4. Runs every time you save changes

### How It Works

1. **You write code and tests**
2. **You save changes to GitHub**
3. **GitHub Actions automatically runs your tests**
4. **You get a report showing if everything works**

### Looking at the Workflow

Open `.github/workflows/test.yml` to see how it's set up. Don't worry about understanding all of it - just know that it:
- Runs Python tests on different Python versions
- Runs Selenium tests with Chrome
- Runs JavaScript tests with Playwright
- Generates reports

## 🎓 Hands-On Learning Tasks

Now it's time to practice! These tasks will give you 2+ hours of hands-on experience with testing.

### Task 1: Python Testing Basics (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Write your first Python test and understand how assertions work.

```bash
# Create a new file for your tests
touch python_tests/my_first_tests.py  # Mac/Linux
# Or create it manually in your text editor
```

**Step 2**: Write tests for a simple calculator function

```python
# Add this to my_first_tests.py
import pytest

def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Add two numbers together"""
    return a + b

def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    """Multiply two numbers"""
    return a * b

class TestMyCalculator:
    def test_add_positive_numbers(self):
        """Test adding two positive numbers"""
        result = add_numbers(5, 3)
        assert result == 8
    
    def test_add_negative_numbers(self):
        """Test adding two negative numbers"""
        result = add_numbers(-5, -3)
        assert result == -8
    
    def test_multiply_by_zero(self):
        """Test multiplying by zero"""
        result = multiply_numbers(5, 0)
        assert result == 0
    
    # TODO: Add your own test here!
    def test_your_custom_test(self):
        """Write a test for something you want to check"""
        # Your code here
        pass
```

**Step 3**: Run your tests
```bash
pytest python_tests/my_first_tests.py -v
```

**Step 4**: Try to break your tests
- Change `assert result == 8` to `assert result == 9`
- Run the test again and see what happens
- Change it back to the correct value

**Learning Questions**:
- What happens when a test fails?
- How do you know which test failed?
- What information does pytest give you when a test passes?

### Task 2: Testing with Fixtures (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Learn how to use fixtures to prepare data for tests.

**Step 1**: Create a test file for fixtures
```bash
touch python_tests/test_fixtures.py
```

**Step 2**: Write tests that use fixtures

```python

@pytest.fixture
def sample_student():
    """Create a sample student for testing"""
    return {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 20,
        "grades": [85, 90, 78, 92]
    }

@pytest.fixture
def empty_classroom():
    """Create an empty classroom"""
    return []

def test_student_has_name(sample_student):
    """Test that student has a name"""
    assert "name" in sample_student
    assert sample_student["name"] == "Alice"

def test_calculate_average_grade(sample_student):
    """Test calculating average grade"""
    grades = sample_student["grades"]
    average = sum(grades) / len(grades)
    assert average == 86.25

def test_add_student_to_classroom(sample_student, empty_classroom):
    """Test adding a student to a classroom"""
    empty_classroom.append(sample_student)
    assert len(empty_classroom) == 1
    assert empty_classroom[0]["name"] == "Alice"

# TODO: Create your own fixture and test
@pytest.fixture
def your_fixture():
    """Create your own fixture here"""
    # Your code here
    pass

def test_your_fixture(your_fixture):
    """Test using your fixture"""
    # Your code here
    pass
```

**Step 3**: Run your tests
```bash
pytest python_tests/test_fixtures.py -v
```

**Learning Questions**:
- What is the difference between a fixture and a regular function?
- When would you use a fixture instead of creating data in each test?
- How do fixtures make your tests cleaner?

### Task 3: Web Scraping Tests (45 minutes)

**Goal**: Learn how to test code that interacts with websites.

**Step 1**: Look at the existing web scraping tests
```bash
# Open the file and read through it
cat python_tests/test_web_scraping.py
```

**Step 2**: Create your own web scraping test
```bash
touch python_tests/test_my_web_scraping.py
```

**Step 3**: Write tests for a weather API

```python
import pytest
import requests

def get_weather_info(city):
    """Get weather information for a city"""
    # This is a free weather API
    url = f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
    params = {
        "q": city,
        "appid": "demo",  # In real life, you'd use a real API key
        "units": "metric"
    }
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    return response

def test_weather_api_responds():
    """Test that weather API responds"""
    response = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/json")
    assert response.status_code == 200

def test_weather_api_has_correct_format():
    """Test that weather API returns JSON"""
    response = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/json")
    data = response.json()
    assert "slideshow" in data  # httpbin/json always has slideshow

# TODO: Write a test for a real website
def test_real_website():
    """Test a real website"""
    # Try testing https://httpbin.org/get
    # What should you check?
    pass
```

**Step 4**: Run your tests
```bash
pytest python_tests/test_my_web_scraping.py -v
```

**Learning Questions**:
- What's the difference between testing your own code vs testing external websites?
- Why might tests that use the internet sometimes fail?
- How can you test code that depends on external services?

### Task 4: Selenium Web Testing (45 minutes)

**Goal**: Learn how to control web browsers with Selenium.

**Step 1**: Create your own Selenium test file
```bash
touch selenium_tests/my_web_tests.py
```

```python
import pytest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def driver():
    """Create a browser for testing"""
    options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
    options.add_argument("--headless")  # Run without showing browser
    options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
    options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
    
    service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=options)
    driver.implicitly_wait(10)
    
    yield driver
    driver.quit()

def test_visit_httpbin(driver):
    """Test visiting httpbin.org"""
    driver.get("https://httpbin.org/")
    
    # Wait for the page to load
    WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.TAG_NAME, "body"))
    )
    
    # Check that we're on the right page
    assert "httpbin" in driver.title.lower()

def test_find_elements_on_page(driver):
    """Test finding elements on a webpage"""
    driver.get("https://httpbin.org/")
    
    # Find all links on the page
    links = driver.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "a")
    assert len(links) > 0, "Should find at least one link"
    
    # Check that the page has a body
    body = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "body")
    assert body.is_displayed()

# TODO: Write your own web test
def test_your_website(driver):
    """Test a website of your choice"""
    # Pick a simple website (like httpbin.org/get)
    # What would you like to test about it?
    pass
```

**Step 3**: Run your Selenium tests

**Step 4**: Try running with visible browser
```python
# Change this line in your fixture:
# options.add_argument("--headless")  # Comment this out to see browser
```

**Learning Questions**:
- What's the difference between headless and visible browser testing?
- Why do we need to wait for elements to appear on web pages?
- How can you test user interactions like clicking buttons?

### Task 5: JavaScript Testing (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Learn how to test JavaScript code in browsers.

**Step 1**: Open the interactive testing playground

test('My custom math test', () => {
    assertEqual(10 + 5, 15);
    assertEqual(100 / 4, 25);
});

test('My custom string test', () => {
    const greeting = "Hello, Testing!";
    assertTrue(greeting.includes("Testing"));
    assertEqual(greeting.length, 16);
});

test('My custom array test', () => {
    const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
    colors.push("yellow");
    assertEqual(colors.length, 4);
    assertEqual(colors[3], "yellow");
});

// TODO: Write your own test
test('Your custom test', () => {
    // What would you like to test?
    // Try testing:
    // - Math operations
    // - String manipulation  
    // - Array methods
    // - Object properties
    pass
});
```

**Step 4**: Run your tests
- Refresh the webpage
- Click "Run All Tests"
- See your new tests in the results!

**Learning Questions**:

**Step 1**: Create a test file for error handling
```bash
touch python_tests/test_error_handling.py
```

**Step 2**: Write tests that check error conditions

```python
import pytest

def divide_numbers(a, b):
    """Divide two numbers, handling division by zero"""
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

# calculator.py
class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
    
    def add(self, a, b):
        """Add two numbers"""
        result = a + b
        self.history.append(f"{a} + {b} = {result}")
        return result
    
    def subtract(self, a, b):
        """Subtract two numbers"""
        result = a - b
        self.history.append(f"{a} - {b} = {result}")
        return result
    
    def multiply(self, a, b):
        """Multiply two numbers"""
        result = a * b
        self.history.append(f"{a} * {b} = {result}")
        return result
    
    def divide(self, a, b):
        """Divide two numbers"""
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        result = a / b
        self.history.append(f"{a} / {b} = {result}")
        return result
    
    def get_history(self):
        """Get calculation history"""
        return self.history.copy()
    
    def clear_history(self):
        """Clear calculation history"""
        self.history = []
```

**Step 3**: Write comprehensive tests
```bash
touch python_tests/test_calculator_coverage.py
```

```python
import pytest
from calculator import Calculator

@pytest.fixture
def calc():
    """Create a calculator for testing"""
    return Calculator()

def test_add(calc):
    """Test addition"""
    assert calc.add(2, 3) == 5
    assert calc.add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert calc.add(0, 0) == 0

def test_subtract(calc):
    """Test subtraction"""
    assert calc.subtract(5, 3) == 2
    assert calc.subtract(0, 5) == -5

def test_multiply(calc):
    """Test multiplication"""
    assert calc.multiply(3, 4) == 12
    assert calc.multiply(0, 5) == 0

def test_divide(calc):
    """Test division"""
    assert calc.divide(10, 2) == 5
    assert calc.divide(7, 2) == 3.5

def test_divide_by_zero(calc):
    """Test division by zero"""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Cannot divide by zero"):
        calc.divide(10, 0)

def test_history(calc):
    """Test calculation history"""
    calc.add(1, 2)
    calc.multiply(3, 4)
    
    history = calc.get_history()
    assert len(history) == 2
    assert "1 + 2 = 3" in history
    assert "3 * 4 = 12" in history

def test_clear_history(calc):
    """Test clearing history"""
    calc.add(1, 2)
    assert len(calc.get_history()) == 1
    
    calc.clear_history()
    assert len(calc.get_history()) == 0

# TODO: Add more tests to achieve 100% coverage
# What other scenarios should you test?
```

**Step 4**: Run tests with coverage
```bash
pytest python_tests/test_calculator_coverage.py --cov=calculator --cov-report=html -v
```

**Step 5**: View coverage report
```bash
open htmlcov/index.html  # Mac
start htmlcov/index.html  # Windows
```

**Learning Questions**:
- What does test coverage tell you?
- Is 100% coverage always necessary?
- How can coverage reports help you write better tests?

### Task 9: Performance Testing (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Learn how to test if your code runs fast enough.

**Step 1**: Create a performance test file
```bash
touch python_tests/test_performance.py
```

import pytest
import time

def slow_function(n):
    """A function that takes some time to complete"""
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i
    return total

def fast_function(n):
    """A function that should be fast"""
    return n * (n - 1) // 2

def test_slow_function_performance():
    """Test that slow function completes in reasonable time"""
    start_time = time.time()
    result = slow_function(100000)
    end_time = time.time()
    
    duration = end_time - start_time
    assert duration < 1.0, f"Function took {duration:.2f}s, expected < 1s"
    assert result == 4999950000

def test_fast_function_performance():
    """Test that fast function is indeed fast"""
    start_time = time.time()
    result = fast_function(100000)
    end_time = time.time()
    
    duration = end_time - start_time
    assert duration < 0.1, f"Function took {duration:.2f}s, expected < 0.1s"
    assert result == 4999950000

def test_function_comparison():
    """Compare performance of two implementations"""
    n = 10000
    
    # Test slow implementation
    start = time.time()
    slow_result = slow_function(n)
    slow_time = time.time() - start
    
    # Test fast implementation
    start = time.time()
    fast_result = fast_function(n)
    fast_time = time.time() - start
    
    # Results should be the same
    assert slow_result == fast_result
    
    # Fast should be faster
    assert fast_time < slow_time, f"Fast ({fast_time:.3f}s) should be faster than slow ({slow_time:.3f}s)"

# TODO: Write your own performance test
def test_your_performance():
    """Test performance of your own function"""
    # Create a function and test its performance
    # What's a reasonable time limit?
    pass
```

**Step 3**: Run performance tests
```bash
pytest python_tests/test_performance.py -v
```

**Learning Questions**:
- Why is performance testing important?
- How do you decide what's "fast enough"?
- When might performance tests be unreliable?

## 🆘 When Things Go Wrong

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### Problem: "pytest: command not found"
**What it means**: Python or pytest isn't installed properly
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if Python is installed
python --version

# If Python works, install pytest
pip install pytest

# If pip doesn't work, try:
python -m pip install pytest
```

#### Problem: "ChromeDriver not found"
**What it means**: Selenium can't find Chrome browser
**Solution**:
```bash
# Update webdriver-manager
pip install --upgrade webdriver-manager

# Or install Chrome manually and add to PATH
```

#### Problem: "Module not found" errors
**What it means**: Python can't find your test files
**Solution**:
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right folder
pwd  # Should show .../testing_v2

# Make sure virtual environment is activated
# You should see (venv) at the start of your command prompt
```

#### Problem: Tests run but don't find anything
**What it means**: Test files aren't named correctly
**Solution**:
- Test files must start with `test_` or end with `_test.py`
- Example: `test_basic.py` ✅, `basic_test.py` ✅, `basic.py` ❌

#### Problem: Selenium tests are slow or fail
**What it means**: Browser issues or network problems
**Solution**:
```bash
# Run with visible browser to see what's happening
pytest selenium_tests/ --browser=visible -v

# Check your internet connection
# Some tests need to visit external websites
```

#### Problem: JavaScript tests don't run
**What it means**: Browser or Node.js issues
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check Node.js installation
node --version

# Reinstall Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# Try opening the HTML file directly in browser
open javascript_tests/index.html
```

### Getting Help

**If you're stuck**:
1. **Read the error message carefully** - it usually tells you what's wrong
2. **Check this guide** - look for similar problems in the troubleshooting section
3. **Try the simple examples first** - make sure basic tests work before trying complex ones
4. **Ask for help** - share the exact error message when asking for assistance

**Useful commands for debugging**:
```bash
# Check what's installed
pip list | grep pytest
npm list

# Check Python path
which python
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"

# Check Node.js path
which node
which npm
```
